## About Me

I am an experienced Project Coordinator with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry. Skilled in SolidWorks, Asset Management, Team Building and Blogging. I would describe myself as a sea trapped inside a water droplet because I have a vast array of experience outside of my university career. I am also interested in the medical field and I am not only focused on the information and technology sector.
