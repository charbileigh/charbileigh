🌸🌸
I am a friendly and passionate individual with diverse interests and skills. Professionally, I work as a QA Tester and Application Support specialist. I have a keen eye for detail and a strong understanding of software testing and troubleshooting. I am constantly looking for ways to improve processes and achieve the best possible results.

In my career, I have had the opportunity to work with various industries and organisations, which has given me a comprehensive understanding of the tech world. My experience has taught me the importance of adaptability and problem-solving, and I bring that to every project I work on.

I am a firm believer in the importance of constant learning and growth. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering and a Postgraduate Degree in Disability Studies from the University of Cape Town (UCT).
